# API

The FastAPI backend for GKORM lives in this directory.

- `main.py` – application entrypoint that configures routes and CORS.
- `app/` – package containing database models, route definitions, and utilities.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies for the service.
- `Dockerfile` – container definition for running the API.
